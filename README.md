## üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity-related Python Scripts for Learning

[](https://github.com/PabloFl07/PythonSecLab/blob/main/README.md#Ô∏è-cybersecurity-related-python-scripts-for-learning)

**PythonCyberLab** is a repository dedicated to **storing, documenting, and explaining** Python scripts related to cybersecurity, with a focus on **Red Teaming**. This repository aims to help anyone learn and apply fundamental **concepts of both pentesting and Python** in a practical way or freely use the scripts in their own projects.

## üìö Content

- **Cybersecurity Scripts**:
    - Scripts that address various cybersecurity needs, such as cryptography, exploitation, reconnaissance, and more. These scripts are inspired by existing tools and techniques in the field.
    - While most scripts will be created by me, contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit your own ideas and improvements.
- **Documentation**:
    - Detailed explanations of the fundamentals behind each script, making it easier to understand the logic and methods used.
